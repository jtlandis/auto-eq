## Heading

This filter adds formatting to heading text.

We have an inline $x + y = z$ equation as well. The difference is this one has a label $x^2 +y^2 = z^2$

$$
1 + 1 = 2
$$ {#eq-first}

$$
1 + 2 = 3
$$

$$
3+3 \not= 5
$$ {#eq-third}

This is latex equation

\begin{equation}
4-1 = 3
\end{equation}
