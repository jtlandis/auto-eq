## Heading

This filter adds formatting to heading text.

We have an inline $x + y = z$ equation as well. The difference is this one has a label $x^2 +y^2 = z^2$

$$
1 + 1 = 2
$$ {#eq-first}

With out this filter, the following equation would have no name. You can of course cross reference with `@eq-first` like @eq-first.

$$
1 + 2 = 3
$$

Note, this filter adds tags following the form "eq-unnamed-<unnamedCount>" starting at 0. This theoretically allows you to cross reference these equations @eq-unnamed-0, `@eq-unnamed-0`, but it isn't recommended as the indexes depend on render time. If you want to cross reference equations, you should always label them manually and descriptively.

$$
3+3 \not= 5
$$ {#eq-third}

This is latex equation, these are automatically labeled.

\begin{equation}
4-1 = 3
\end{equation}

One more qmd equation:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
